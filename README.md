# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
Explain to the decision-makers at PyBer in a written report how the data differs by city type by creating a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type using Pandas and also, by creating a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type using Matplotlib. 

## Results:
As seen in the Pyber Summary DataFrame (attached below) the total rides, the total of drivers, the total fares, and the average fare per driver from January to Early May of 2019 differ significantly from city types, but also, it can be observed that there is no much difference on the average fare per ride:

In the following pie charts the percentages of rides, drivers, and fares by city type will be compare for an easier way of showing these differences:

As seen in the images, the rides, the drivers, and the fares are much higher when it comes to the urban city type, and this is due to the population in these areas, the bigger the population the higher the demand for ride services, the smaller the population the less need for ride services. The following chart shows the fares per dates for each city type:

The multiple-line graph above shows the fares per each city type during the period of January to early May of 2019, in this graph the differences between the three city types based on the fares is very clear, making it easier to see the differences from one city type to another. 
## Summary:
In summary, the differences of the ride-sharing data between city types can offer a deep insight of where to work in order to improve the services based on locations or if it is worth having the service in certain locations. Following, there are three recommendations based on the results obtained by the analysis of the ride-sharing data:
1.	Keep or improve a quality service in the urban city type areas to maintain the successful rates.
2.	Concentrate on providing an affordable service in the suburban areas, even though the service in these areas is not as needed as in the urban areas, providing an affordable service around popular businesses in which the client might prefer not to bring its own car for example: airports, nightclubs, train stations, etc. could improve and increased the use of ride services in these city types.
3.	In the rural areas where houses and businesses are commonly located afar from each other, it is normal that most people own personal vehicles, thus the need for ride services is close to zero and when needed since there are so few offering the service the prices might be too high. ByPer might consider:

a.	Offering the service with a slightly different approach when it comes to Rural areas, besides offering the ride service, ByPer could offer a service of delivering goods (groceries, medicines, food, etc.) so the customer could opt for paying a fair amount to do the basics without going all the way to the nearest town, saving in gas and helping the environment. 

b.	Re-directing the efforts and teams in theses areas to a suburban or urban area and just not offering the services in the rural areas.
